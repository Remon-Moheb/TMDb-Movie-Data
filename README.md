# TMDb-Movie-Data
This project dives into a dataset provided by The Movie Database (TMDb) on thousands of different movies. The various properties associated with movies are visualized using multiple different plots to identify patterns in the data and answer the key question.

# Key Questions
What are the factors affecting profit ?
What is the highest year for releasing movies ?
which category is highly voted ?

# Data wrangling and Cleaning
The dataset is loaded into a dataframe from the file called tmdb-movies.csv. The data is inspected and cleaned for analysis. Duplicate rows and irrelevant columns are removed, variables are renamed, and null values are dropped.
